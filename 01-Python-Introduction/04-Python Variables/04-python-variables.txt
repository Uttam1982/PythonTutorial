# Rules and Naming Convention for Variables and constants

1. Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) 
   or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_).

# For example:
snake_case
MACRO_CASE
camelCase
CapWords

2. Create a name that makes sense. For example, name makes more sense than n

3. If you want to create a variable name having two words, use underscore to separate them.

#For example:
my_name
current_salary

4. Use capital letters possible to declare a constant. 

# For example:
PI
G
MASS
SPEED_OF_LIGHT
TEMP

5. Never use special symbols like !, @, #, $, %, etc.
6. Don't start a variable name with a digit.
