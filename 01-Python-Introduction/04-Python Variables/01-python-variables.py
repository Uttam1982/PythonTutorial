# Python Variables
number = 10

# Here, we have created a variable named number. We have assigned the value 10 to the variable.
number = 1.1

# initially, the value of number was 10. Later, it was changed to 1.1


# Example 1: Declaring and assigning value to a variable
person = "Sam"
print(person)

# Example 2: Changing the value of a variable
person ='Joe'
print(person)

# Example 3: Assigning multiple values to multiple variables
a, b, c = 10, 4.5, 'Sam'
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# Example 4: Assigning the same value to multiple variables
x = y = z = 10
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
