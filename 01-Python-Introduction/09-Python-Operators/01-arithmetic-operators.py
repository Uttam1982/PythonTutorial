# Python Operators

# You'll learn everything about different types of operators in Python
# Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. 
# The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

# ******************************************************************************************
# Example 1: Arithmetic operators in Python
x = 15
y = 4

print('x = ',x)
print('y = ',y)

# Output: x + y = 19
print('x + y =',x+y)

# Output: x - y = 11
print('x - y =',x-y)

# Output: x * y = 60
print('x * y =',x*y)

# Output: x / y = 3.75
print('x / y =',x/y)

#Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line
# Output: x // y = 3
print('x // y =',x//y)  

# Output: x ** y = 50625
print('x ** y =',x**y)
