# Python Variable Scope

- A scope is the portion of a program from where a namespace can be 
  accessed directly without any prefix.

- At any given moment, there are at least three nested scopes.

  1. Scope of the current function which has local names
  2. Scope of the module which has global names
  3. Outermost scope which has built-in names

- When a reference is made inside a function, the name is searched in the local namespace, 
  then in the global namespace and finally in the built-in namespace.

- If there is a function inside another function, a new scope is nested inside the local scope.
