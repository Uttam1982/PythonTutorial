#Python Indentation
# - A code block (body of a function, loop, etc.) starts with indentation 
# and ends with the first unindented line.
# - Generally, four whitespaces are used for indentation and are preferred over tabs


for i in range(1,10):
  print(i)
  if i==5:
    break


# - Incorrect indentation will result in IndentationError.
if True:
  print('uttam')
  a=5
