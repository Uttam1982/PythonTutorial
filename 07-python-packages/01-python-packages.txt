# What are packages?

Similar files are kept in the same directory, for example, 
we may keep all the songs in the "music" directory. Similarly, 
Python has packages for directories and modules for files.

As our application program grows larger in size with a lot of 
modules, we place similar modules in one package and different 
modules in different packages. This makes a project (program) 
easy to manage and conceptually clear.

Similarly, as a directory can contain subdirectories and files, 
a Python package can have sub-packages and modules.

A directory must contain a file named __init__.py in order for Python 
to consider it as a package. This file can be left empty but we generally 
place the initialization code for that package in this file.
