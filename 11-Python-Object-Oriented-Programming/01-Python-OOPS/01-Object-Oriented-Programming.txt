# Object Oriented Programming

1. One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. 
   This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

2. An object has two characteristics:
  attributes
  behavior

3. Let's take an example:

A Person can be an object,as it has the following properties:

Attributes: name, age, color 
Behavior: singing, dancing

4. The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. 
   This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

5. In Python, the concept of OOP follows some basic principles:
   1. Class
   2. Object
   3. Methods
   4. Inheritence
   5. Encapsulation
   6. Polymorphism
