# Python Constructor

1. A constructor is a special type of method (function) 
   which is used to initialize the instance members of the class.

2. It is used to create an object.

3. Constructors can be of two types.
   a. Parameterized Constructor
   b. Non Parameterized Constructor

4. In Python, the method the __init__() simulates the constructor of the class. 

5. This method is called when the class is instantiated. 

6. It accepts the self-keyword as a first argument which allows accessing 
   the attributes or method of the class.

7. We can pass any number of arguments at the time of creating the class object, 
   depending upon the __init__() defi
   
8. It is mostly used to initialize the class attributes. 

9. Every class must have a constructor, even if it simply relies on the default constructor.
