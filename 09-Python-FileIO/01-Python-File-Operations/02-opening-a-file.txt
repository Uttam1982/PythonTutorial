# Opening Files in Python

# Python has a built-in open() function to open a file. 
# This function returns a file object, also called a handle, 
# as it is used to read or modify the file accordingly.

# We can specify the mode while opening a file. 
# In mode, we specify whether we want to read r, write w or append a to the file. 

# We can also specify if we want to open the file in text mode or binary mode.

# The default is reading in text mode. 
# In this mode, we get strings when reading from the file.

# On the other hand, binary mode returns bytes and this is the mode 
# to be used when dealing with non-text files like images or executable files.


# f = open("test.txt")      # equivalent to 'r' or 'rt'
# f = open("test.txt",'w')  # write in text mode
# f = open("img.bmp",'r+b') # read and write in binary mode


#        f = open("test.txt", mode='r', encoding='utf-8')

# Unlike other languages, the character a does not imply the number 97 
# until it is encoded using ASCII (or other equivalent encodings).

# Moreover, the default encoding is platform dependent. In windows, it is cp1252 
# but utf-8 in Linux.

# So, we must not also rely on the default encoding or 
# else our code will behave differently in different platforms.

# Hence, when working with files in text mode, it is highly recommended 
# to specify the encoding type.
