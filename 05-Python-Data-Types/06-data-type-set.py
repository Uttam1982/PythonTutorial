# Python Set
# - Set is an unordered collection of unique items. 
# - Items in a set are not ordered.
# - Set is defined by values separated by comma inside braces { }. 
# - We can perform set operations like union, intersection on two sets. 
# - Sets have unique values. 
# - They eliminate duplicates.


a = { 5, 2, 3, 1, 4 }

# printing set variable
print("a = ", a)

# data type of variable a
print(type(a))

# They eliminate duplicates.
a = { 5, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4 }
print("a = ", a)

# Since, set are unordered collection, indexing has no meaning. 
# Hence, the slicing operator [] does not work.
