# What are modules in Python?
# 1. Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions.
# 2. A file containing Python code, for example: example.py, is called a module, 
     and its module name would be example.
# 3. We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. 
     Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.
# 4. We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying 
     their definitions into different programs.
