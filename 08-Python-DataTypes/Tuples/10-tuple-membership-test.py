# 1. Tuple Membership Test
# We can test if an item exists in a tuple or not, using the keyword in.

my_tuple = (12,23,34,45,56,67,78,89,90)

# In operation
print("23 in my_tuple: ",23 in my_tuple) #True


# not in operation
print("23 not in my_tuple: ",23 not in my_tuple) #False

# not in operation
print("43 not in my_tuple: ",43 not in my_tuple) #True
