# Python Sets

1. A set is an unordered collection of items. 

2. Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and 

3. must be immutable (cannot be changed).

4. However, a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.

5. Sets can also be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, 
   intersection, symmetric difference, etc.
