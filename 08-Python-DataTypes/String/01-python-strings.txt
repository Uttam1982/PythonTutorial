# Python Strings
1. A string is a sequence of characters.
2. A character is simply a symbol. For example, the English language has 26 characters.
3. Computers do not deal with characters, they deal with numbers (binary).
4. This conversion of character to a number is called encoding, and the reverse process is decoding. 
5. ASCII and Unicode are some of the popular encodings used.
6. In Python, a string is a sequence of Unicode characters. 
7. Unicode was introduced to include every character in all languages and bring 
   uniformity in encoding.
